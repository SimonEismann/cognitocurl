# cognitocurl üîè
This is CLI tool that allows you to easily sign curl calls to API Gateway with Cognito authorization token.

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/cognitocurl.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/cognitocurl)

## Why?
AWS Cognito is really powerful, especially combined with API Gateway, but if you use Cognito Authorizer or Lambda Authorizer based on Authorization header, you may encounter a problem with signing curl calls - this is why we created `cognitocurl` - it is tiny CLI tool made with Node.js that takes care of signing in against user pool, persisting and rotating tokens, and adding additional header to your curl call.

Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è in Nordcloud
